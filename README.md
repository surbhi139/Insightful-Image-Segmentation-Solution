# Insightful-Image-Segmentation-Solution

Overview

This project demonstrates the use of advanced Transformer-based models for Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks, specifically focusing on text classification and language understanding. The project explores pre-trained transformer models like BERT, DistilBERT, and GPT to analyze, classify, and understand text data efficiently.

Key Features

Text Classification: Utilizes transformer models (BERT, DistilBERT, etc.) to classify text into various categories.
Language Understanding: Implements NLP techniques like tokenization, embedding, and attention mechanisms for accurate language comprehension.
Fine-tuning Pre-trained Models: Leverages pre-trained transformer models for specific NLP tasks, allowing faster training and improved accuracy.
Model Comparison: Compares the performance of different transformer models on various NLP tasks.

Technologies Used

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
DistilBERT: A distilled, faster version of BERT.
GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
Hugging Face Transformers: For easy implementation and training of state-of-the-art models.
Python: Programming language used for data preprocessing, model building, and evaluation.
TensorFlow / PyTorch: Deep learning frameworks for implementing transformer models.
NLTK / SpaCy: For preprocessing and tokenization of text data.
